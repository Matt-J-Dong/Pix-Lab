# Pix-Lab
Worked with a project that manipulated the colors of pictures by adjusting the RGB values of individual pixels. Object encapsulation, 2-dimensional arrays, and various logical methods were utilized to create the finished product.
PixMethods and IntArrayWorker are the two files that I personally edited.
